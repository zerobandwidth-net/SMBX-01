# SMBX-01 #

This is a game project for Super Mario Bros. X, called "The Endless Self-Tutorial". It is my first foray into creating an SMBX game, and as such, it's just a hodgepodge of whatever design elements I felt like learning about on a given day. There's not yet any overarching plot, or design, or goal. They're just fun levels. Or, at least, I think so. I've made the game challenging for my level of ability, which is arguably middle-of-the-road.

Enjoy.
